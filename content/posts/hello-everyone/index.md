## What I Do?
I do a lot of things, but primarily I alternate between writing short stories, working on my first novel, playing video games, and am the Storyteller for an Exalted 3rd edition game. I often end up talking to people about writing and video games, in particular *World of Warcraft* and *Final Fantasy XIV*, which are the main games I end up playing. I am also a player in multiple TTRPG games. I play Dungeons & Dragons on Sundays, Monster of the Week on Wednesdays, and Exalted 3rd Edition as a player on Thursdays. I also want to start running a few more TTRPG games, in particular I would like to run another Exalted 3e game and I might want to run a D&D 5e game as well.
## Streaming
- [Twitch.TV](https://www.twitch.tv/erasvolteal): I stream on Monday, Tuesday, and Fridays at 15:00 (3PM) Central European Time.
	- Monday: I spend one to two hours working on writing projects before swapping to playing games.
	- Tuesday: I mainly stream games. I try to do PvP with viewers if I play World of Warcraft, or try to play co-op if I am playing a multi-player game.
	- Friday: I spend two hours working on TTRPG prep for my Saturday game of Exalted 3e.
## My Current Projects
### Exalted 3e - Dragon Blooded Campaign
I run an exalted 3e game every Saturday for a group of friends. While I do not stream the game, I want to start writing journal entries or something like it to both keep track of the campaign and to have stuff I can post places to hopefully inspire other Storytellers.
### Role-play Journals
#### World of Warcraft
- [Bishop Ishala the Pious](https://ishala.carrd.co/): The main character I play on *World of Warcraft*. An ancient draenei woman who traces her roots back to ancient Arugs. She has held many titles and positions over the course of her long life, but she has left most of them behind. She has settled down in the small town of Harborage in the Swamp of Sorrows and now serves as the liaison between the town, the Kingdom of Stormwind, and the human church. Holding the rank of Bishop within the human church for the role she plays.

### Writing - Original Fiction
#### Short Stories
- [Honor Duel](https://archiveofourown.org/works/58792786): After being challenged to an honor duel by a woman whose advance she had spurred, Princess Mira MÃ©vouillot finds herself restless about the prospect of fighting to the death over something so minor.
- [Nadia, Tianitha, and the Basement Monster](https://archiveofourown.org/works/58792630): In the middle of the night, a pair of twins hear suspicious sounds coming from the basement. Determined they do not need the help of adults, they go and investigate on their own!
#### Novel
I am currently working on a novel, but it is still in the planning phase and the idea is still evolving as I am planning. I will be posting about this in depth once the idea has solidified more. I will be posting some of the conceptual ideas I have on this blog to share the ideas I have and honestly to show off some of the process!
### Writing - Fan Fiction
#### The World of Warcraft Fanzine created by [Rease Stoneheart](https://bsky.app/profile/reasestoneheart.bsky.social)
The World of Warcraft Fanzine project is a wonderful collaboration project started by Rease Stoneheart with the intent of letting people show off the talent that Warcraft brings out in them. Showcasing art, stories, screenshots, and more from people who want to show what they're capable of, have fun, reach an audience, or feel more confident in themselves and their art and what they're capable of while we celebrate a franchise that we all love! I enjoyed writing the story I submitted for the first issue and enjoyed getting to write my a character I created in my favourite game (and universe)! I also loved getting to know many more wonderful writers and artists and getting to read what they submitted to the first, second, and soon third issues of the fanzine.

These are the issues I have contributed to so far:
- [Issue 1: Season of Changes - Memories and Novices by Angela Ridder](https://reasestoneheart.gumroad.com/l/fanzineissue1)
- Issue 3: Rust, Bombshells, and Riches - The Blessing of the Lunar Cycles by Angela Ridder **(Will release June 1st!)**

If you are interested in submitting to the Fanzine Project, you can find more information on my friend [Rease Stoneheart's Open Call Post](https://reasegaming.substack.com/p/fc9b2db8-747e-405b-8c0d-408b728639b4)!

With that, I think I have yapped enough about things, and it is time for me to get some work done!
