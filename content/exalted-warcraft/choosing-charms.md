# Choosing Charms

Selecting which Charms a character should start with is perhaps the most daunting decision a player faces when building their character. This section will help players new to the game decide how to get started or give experienced players a template to build from. These templates can also be used to make characters quickly for off-the-cuff and one-shot games. The Charms listed in this section are all found in Chapter Six, beginning on p. 165.
