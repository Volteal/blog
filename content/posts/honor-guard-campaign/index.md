## Basic Information

**Game Title**: Honour Guard | A Dragon-Blooded Exalted 3e Campaign
**Game System**: Exalted 3rd Edition
**Game Hook**: A group of young scions of the twelve Great Houses have been sent to the frozen north to serve as the Satrap's ceremonial Honor Guard. What could go wrong?
**Game Themes**: Fantasy, High Fantasy, Mystery, Political Intrigue
**Game Description**: Nestled amidst in the northwest of creation, amidst a snow blanketed coast, lays the city of Fajad like a shining beacon of civilization in the frozen tundra. The city is a strangely temperate place, its harbor free of ice, snow melting as it touches the particolored domes of the prince’s palace and the Grand Mosque’s airy minarets. The alien warmth grows strongest at the city’s heart, where steaming hot springs gather at the base of the thousand-foot stony spire called the Needle.

A grand festival approaches, one that honors the founding ancestors who build the city from nothing with their blood, sweat, and lives. Everyone of note within the city will be attending, from the leaders of the merchants and artisans guilds and local nobility to monks of the immaculate order and representatives of the realm. Hushed rumors around the local populace even has it that the Scarlet Empress herself was invited!

At the behest of Fajad's Satrap, Cathak Mei, young scions of the twelve great houses have been sent to serve as her ceremonial Honor Guard.
