## Hello there, and welcome to my Safehouse in a Cyberpunk Dystopia.
My name is Angela Ridder, and I am a professional Decker, Rigger, and Storyteller. This is my safehouse where I typically post what I want, when I want it. Most of it is related to either: Gaming, Writing, TTRPGs, etc. A lot of it is focused on my writing and my writing journey. I will post status updates on what I am working on, ideas I have and my thought process, a good bit of world building content too. I will also be posting summaries of the TTRPG campaigns I run in the hopes of maybe inspiring other Storytellers (with this I mean Dungeon Masters, but this term sounds less kink related IMHO) or giving advice to people wanting to be one.

I will sometimes also post about my World of Warcraft RP, PvE, and PvP shenanigans typically for the fun of it or because I am proud of a thing I did, but sometimes because I feel there is not enough content on the internet that explains properly why we do certain things the way we do. Most written and even YouTube guides boil down to "Copy this build and do this" but barely address why we take the talents in the build, much less when and how to alter the build.

I will likely also post other things here! There is a lot I can, and want to, talk about.
### Why Call This a Safehouse in a Cyberpunk Dystopia?
My default answers is best summed up by these songs:
- [If the People Unite by Seth Staton Watkins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIaaV9H5680)
- [Stand Together by Seth Staton Watkins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQegy1exLdc)
**But if a song is not enough**: Why not? The Internet is fast turning into a cyberpunk dystopia run by megacorporations eager to farm you for all the money and personal information that they can to make even more money off you. AI scraping bots are running amok on the web hitting servers so often they cause immense bandwidth usage bull all the while slurping up every image, scrap of text, piece of music, etc. in a Copyright Violation blitzkrieg like it's the fucking 1930s all over again to feed their incompetent plagiarism machines, so companies can replace real human writers and artists with machines so they can save money to keep the illusion of "line go up permanently" for their monkey brained shareholders while most of the working population is forced to take jobs that are basically modern-day slave labour (looking at you and how you run your warehouses, Amazon).

Furthermore, union busting is basically allowed, if not outright encouraged by politicians seeing as no meaningful action is ever taken against companies who engage in it. The biggest punishment is a fine that for a corporation is like fining an individual only $0.75 for multiple systematic assault and battery convictions. Are unions a perfect solution? No, nothing is and nothing can ever be a perfect solution. However, they are a way for the working class people to stand up against corporations that can basically funnel infinite money to a team of lawyers to either stall a case where an individual sues them until the individual is out of legal funds or simply steam roll the case by the virtue of having 6+ lawyers working to win the case.

So yes, this is a safehouse. This is my little safe spot in the dystopian city that is the internet. Where I can shout into the voice about what I am doing, what I want to do, who I like, etc. A place where I can do what I want and no one can stop me from doing it. I can't change the world, I can'tâ€™ make things better, but I can entertain people with my LGBTQIA+ friendly stories, the silly ideas I have, the things I love, and sharing important things I learn along the way.

Are you still here? Good, that means you likely agree, and we will get along just fine!
