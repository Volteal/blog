## Who Am I?
Greetings and salutations! I am Angela Ridder a fantasy and science fiction writer.

## What I Do?
I do a lot of things but I primarily alternate between writing short stories, working on a novel, and playing video games. I often talk about video games, in particular *World of Warcraf*t and *Final Fantasy XIV*. In world of Warcraft I play mostly Player-vs-Player content and I stream that content at times on [Twitch.TV](https://www.twitch.tv/erasvolteal), I try to stream every Monday, Tueseday, and Friday. I stream a mixture of games, writing, and TTRPG game prep.
